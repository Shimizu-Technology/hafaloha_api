# VIP-Only Checkout System

## Overview

The VIP-Only Checkout System allows restaurant administrators to restrict checkout functionality to users with valid VIP access codes during special events. This feature enables restaurants to create exclusive dining experiences while still allowing all users to browse the menu.

## Key Components

### Database Structure

1. **VipAccessCode Model**
   - Stores individual VIP codes linked to special events
   - Tracks usage, expiration, and activation status
   - Supports both individual and group codes

2. **SpecialEvent Model**
   - Can be marked as VIP-only
   - Contains a collection of VIP access codes
   - Can be set as the current event for a restaurant

3. **Restaurant Model**
   - Has a toggle for VIP-enabled mode (replaces the deprecated vip_only_mode)
   - References the current special event
   - Stores a default code prefix for VIP codes

### Backend Implementation

1. **VipCodeGenerator Service**
   - Generates unique VIP codes with configurable prefixes
   - Supports both individual and batch code generation
   - Creates group codes with shared usage limits

2. **VipAccessController**
   - Validates VIP codes against the current event
   - Tracks code usage
   - Provides endpoints for frontend validation

3. **OrdersController Integration**
   - Validates VIP codes during checkout
   - Rejects orders without valid VIP codes when required
   - Increments code usage upon successful order placement

4. **Admin Controllers**
   - Manage special events and VIP codes
   - Toggle VIP-only mode for restaurants
   - Set current events

### Frontend Implementation

1. **VIP Code Input Component**
   - Appears conditionally during checkout when VIP mode is active
   - Validates codes in real-time
   - Provides clear feedback to users

2. **Admin Settings**
   - VIP Event Settings for creating and managing special events
   - VIP Code Settings for configuring code prefixes
   - VIP Mode Toggle for enabling/disabling VIP-only checkout

3. **Store Integration**
   - Restaurant store tracks VIP mode status
   - Order store handles VIP code validation during checkout

## User Flows

### Customer Flow

1. User browses the menu (available to all users)
2. User adds items to cart
3. During checkout:
   - If VIP mode is inactive: normal checkout process
   - If VIP mode is active: user must enter a valid VIP code
4. Upon successful validation, order is processed

### Admin Flow

1. Admin creates a special event (optionally marking it as VIP-only)
2. Admin generates VIP codes for the event
3. Admin sets the event as current for the restaurant
4. Admin toggles VIP-only mode on/off as needed

## Security Considerations

- VIP code validation occurs on both frontend and backend
- Codes can be limited by usage count and expiration date
- Admin-only access to code generation and management
- Restaurant-scoped codes prevent cross-restaurant usage

## Future Extensions

The system is designed to be extensible for future enhancements:

- Tiered VIP access levels
- Special menu items available only to VIP users
- Integration with loyalty programs
- Analytics on VIP code usage and conversion rates
- Time-limited VIP access windows

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:

- Model tests for VipAccessCode, SpecialEvent, and Restaurant
- Controller tests for all VIP-related endpoints
- Service tests for VipCodeGenerator
- Integration tests for the checkout process

## Conclusion

The VIP-Only Checkout System provides a flexible and secure way to create exclusive dining experiences while maintaining an open browsing experience for all users. The implementation follows best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability.
